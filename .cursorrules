# Cursor Project Rules — BLUEBIRD 4.0

## Memory Bank (Required)
- Always start work by reading all core Memory Bank files in `memory-bank/`:
  - `projectbrief.md`
  - `productContext.md`
  - `activeContext.md`
  - `systemPatterns.md`
  - `techContext.md`
  - `progress.md`

## Role / Operating Model (Important)
- **This agent’s job is to advise and analyze.**
  - Provide: gap analysis, risk reviews, operational checklists, incident reviews, and high-signal recommendations.
  - Avoid: implementing code changes unless the user explicitly asks this agent to do so.
- **Coding/implementation work is handled by Claude Code.**
  - When implementation is needed, respond with: what to change, where, why, and validation steps.
- **North Star goal**: the trading system’s only goal is to **make money** (profitability), while respecting risk limits and avoiding avoidable blow-ups.

## Timestamps
- Any new entry in `memory-bank/activeContext.md` and `memory-bank/progress.md` must be timestamped:
  - Format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]`

## Security / Secrets
- Do not edit `.env` unless explicitly asked.
- Never write secrets/tokens into Memory Bank or logs.

## Operational Discipline
- Prefer durable logs for incident review; `/tmp` may be cleared on reboot.
- After crashes/restarts, run a standard verification set:
  - `python start.py --status`
  - `GET /health`
  - `GET /api/db/reconcile`
  - `GET /api/risk/status`
  - `GET /api/risk/overlay`
  - `GET /api/grid/status`

## Repository Facts (Keep Consistent)
- Bot API: `http://localhost:8000`
- Dashboard: `http://localhost:5173`
- Runtime state/locks: `/tmp/bluebird/` and `/tmp/bluebird-*.json`
- DB: `data/bluebird.db`
